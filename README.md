wasg-register : Registers for a new Wireless@SG SSA account
===========================================================

# NOTE: DEPRECATED!

IMDA has recently introduced a new method for connecting to Wireless@SGx,
which can be done via a website on non-Windows/Mac machines. Harish Pillay
has provided a [writeup](https://harishpillay.com/2025/01/20/wirelesssgx-for-linux-2025-update/)
documenting the exact details. With this method, the `wasg-register` script
provided here is no longer needed, and thus I won't be updating it anymore.
Discussion about this can also be found at https://github.com/zerotypic/wasg-register/issues/34;
thanks [@sunnykoh](https://github.com/sunnykoh) for bringing this to our attention.

tldr:
1. Go to https://eservice.imda.gov.sg/wirelessSGx/
2. Click "Device without local SIM", "Android/ChromeOS & Other Operating Systems", "Create Profile"
3. Enter details to obtain required creds

# OLD DOCUMENTATION BELOW

wasg-register.py is a Python implementation of the Wireless@SG SSA
registration protocol.

Please see [this article](https://medium.com/@zerotypic/making-wireless-sgx-work-on-linux-92216c66fdb7)
for more information (note, article might be out of date due to API
changes since it was written).

## Dependencies

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Requires a version of pycryptodome that supports AES in CCM mode.

## Basic Usage

To create an account, you need to supply a valid mobile number (to which
an OTP will be sent via SMS) and a date of birth. A mobile number / date
of birth pair will be used to uniquely identify a user account.

```
# To use: python3 wasg-register.py <mobile number> <dob>
$ python3 wasg-register.py 659XXXXXXX 24031980
OTP will be sent to mobile phone number 659XXXXXXX
Enter OTP to continue: XXXXXX
Credentials:
 userid = 'XXX'
 password = 'XXX'
```
where `dob` is a date of birth in DDMMYYYY format.

If you have previously created an account with the same mobile number /
date of birth pair, you can request for a new set of credentials using
*retrieve mode*:

```
$ python3 wasg-register.py -r 659XXXXXXX 24031980
OTP will be sent to mobile phone number 659XXXXXXX
Enter OTP to continue: XXXXXX
Credentials:
 userid = 'XXX'
 password = 'XXX'
```

### Docker

You can use Docker to build an image with all the dependencies included.

```
# Build
$ docker build -t wasg-register .

# Register mode
$ docker run -it --rm wasg-register 659XXXXXXX 24031980
[snip]

# Retrieve mode
$ docker run -it --rm wasg-register -r 659XXXXXXX 24031980
[snip]
```

## Configuration Tips

### WPA Supplicant

Koo Zhengqun supplied a `wpa_supplicant.conf` configuration for Wireless@SGx that works in Void Linux:

```
network={
        ssid="Wireless@SGx"
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        eap=PEAP
        identity="<userid>"
        password="<password>"
}
```

### NetworkManager

[@chuanhao01](https://github.com/chuanhao01) supplied a `<an id/name>.nmconnection` configuartion for Wireless@SGx that works in Archlinux:
```
[wifi-security]
key-mgmt=wpa-eap

[connection]
id=<an id/name>
uuid=<valid UUID>
type=wifi

[wifi]
mode=infrastructure
ssid=Wireless@SGx
security=802-11-wireless-security

[802-1x]
eap=peap
phase2-auth=mschapv2
identity=<userid>
password=<password>

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
method=auto

[proxy]
```
